.SH NAME
man \- Simulates client-server job scheduling/handling via threads.
.SH SYNOPSIS
sim --lambda [0.005] --mu [0.01] --servers [2] --clients [2]
.SH DESCRIPTION
sim is a program that simulates client-server job handling via a simple FIFO queue.
sim consists of three threads: clock, servers, and clients.
There is only one clock thread and it is tasked with simulating time cycles for 1000 iterations.
For each time cycle iteration, the clock thread broadcasts a signal to all other threads.
When a client thread is activated it will generate a random number and see if it is less than lambda. If so the client thread will create a artificial job and place it in the global queue.
When a server thread is activated it will generate a random number and see if it is less than mu. If so, and if the server thread is BUSY with a job, then it will terminate the current job as completed. If the server thread is in a FREE state, then it will attempt to dequeue a job from the global queue.
.SH OPTIONS
